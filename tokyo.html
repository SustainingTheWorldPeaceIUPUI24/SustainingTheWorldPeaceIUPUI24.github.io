        <h2>Returning to Tokyo</h2>
        <h3>We will close out our trip in Tokyo starting June 13th</h3>
        <h3>Exploring Japan: Day 10</h3>
        <p>We awoke early at our hotel in Hiroshima, preparing for a day of Shinkansen travel bound for Tokyo. Along the journey, we were fortunate enough to catch a glimpse of majestic Mt. Fuji before it vanished into the clouds.
         Quick-thinking students managed to capture a few photos before it disappeared entirely. Arriving in Tokyo around 1:30 PM, we made our way to our next hotel. 
        The remainder of the evening was dedicated to working on our website and class portfolios, providing a welcome opportunity for rest before another packed day of learning and exploration ahead. </p>

        <p> Our unforgettable 15-day voyage across Japan has profoundly impacted us, molding us into better versions of ourselves. 
            The people we met, the testimonies we heardâ€”they now reside within us, forever shaping our perspectives. We hold dear the memories and the priceless wisdom gained. 
            It is your generous support that enabled us to undertake this enlightening peace study abroad journey. Your contribution lays the groundwork for forthcoming generations of peace advocates. 
            We extend our heartfelt gratitude for making this journey attainable.
